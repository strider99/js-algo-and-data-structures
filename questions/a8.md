Probably the most interesting question till now.
Settimeout is behaving differently in node and in browser.
In browser the settimeout points to the global window object, the function when executed will print "this is global variable".

But the same program when executed inside a node window, considers the this inside a settimout function to point to the settimeout itself.
So the value of this.a will be undefined as there are no a inside settimeout function.b

it will e very interesting to see how arrow functions affect this permutations and combinations.
